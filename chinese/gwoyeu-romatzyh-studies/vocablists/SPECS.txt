A list of vocabulary words consists of semicolon-separated lines of:
ChineseCharacters;GwoyeuRomatzyh;English

Given a list, the app will produce a new shrunken list of these same words. The idea is to slowly reduce the list to zero, showing that the student is familiar with all words.

Student uploads a file prepared in an external text editor (such as Emacs)

App parses the file and stores the data in memory

Student is given a choice of which representation to show: characters, GR, or English

App randomizes the list and shows the chosen representation one by one.

Student writes by hand the other two representations, and informs app when he or she is done

Student evaluates him or herself, and informs app if he or she wants to add the word to the new shrunken list.

App provides the new list to be saved
