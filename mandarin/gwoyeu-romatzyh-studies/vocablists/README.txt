Read/Write lists of Chinese characters, Gwoyeu Romatzyh, and English

Data is separated by semicolons

For copying books:
(write = by hand, type = on computer, GR = Gwoyeu Romatzyh)

1. Skim a book's sentence, writing GR and leaving spaces marked __'
for unknown characters. Stop at the end of a sentence.

2. Look up the unknown characters and fill in the GR blanks.
Double-check where unsure about the GR. Write the translation.

3. Type the GR, breaking it up into shorter phrases.

4. Type the characters

5. Use Vocablists: Verify to compare with the book

6. Write the characters, using the computer (the large font is
easier to read than the book)

7. Each file should be one page. At the end, compile a list of the
new words. Doing a full translation is cumbersome. Save in a file
words_00# (page number).txt
