Study material and quizzes for Modern Greek

Hosted as a collection of static HTML and JavaScript files.

The content is separated by the interface languages, English (en) and Portuguese (pt). A copy of common content needs to exist in both folders.

Run `php buildgreek.php en` and `php buildgreek.php pt` to generate the static content in each interface language.

# Static pages

The top-level `index.html` must be written independently.

Quizzes are generated by the `buildgreek.php` script.

# Adding new pages

The HTML output and directory structure will be identical to the structure in the top-level `en` and `pt` folders.

Every new folder, even if it is empty, must have an `index.php`. The `$page_title` defined there will appear on the corresponding `index.html` and links.

A new quiz page should follow `quiz-template.php` located in the root folder.

The `$page_title` will appear in the folder listing.

`generateQuizJS` takes two parameters: the quiz title and a list of questions

Each question is `["PROMPT", ["ANS1, "ANS2"], ["PARTIALS"]]`

The list of partial answers may be omitted.
